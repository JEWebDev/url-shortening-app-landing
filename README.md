## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this project

- Client side form validation with javascript and regular expressions

- How to manage the submit event on forms with javascript

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about api consuming and security practices. This time i couldn't implement the API functionality and it doesn't seem trust worthy either. I will update this solution when i have a better understanding about how API's work.
